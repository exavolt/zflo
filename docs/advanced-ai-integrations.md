# Advanced AI Integrations with ZFlo

Beyond using ZFlo flows as playbooks for AI agents, we can embed AI capabilities directly into the flow execution itself. This creates more dynamic, personalized, and intelligent experiences. This document outlines several advanced integration patterns.

## 1. AI-Powered Natural Language Input

This pattern frees the user from being restricted to a fixed set of buttons for their choices.

**Concept**: At a decision node, the user can respond with natural language. An AI model then interprets the user's intent and maps it to one of the predefined outlets.

**How It Works**:

1.  A `ZFNode` is marked with a special property, e.g., `"inputMode": "naturalLanguage"`.
2.  When the `FlowEngine` enters this node, the UI presents a text input field instead of buttons.
3.  The user types their response (e.g., "I guess I'll check out the forest first").
4.  The application sends the user's text and the list of available choices (e.g., `["Explore the forest", "Go to the village"]`) to an AI model.
5.  The AI's task is to perform intent classification, returning the `id` of the best-matching choice.
6.  The `FlowEngine` then proceeds down the selected path as if the user had clicked a button.

**Benefits**:

- Creates a more conversational and natural user experience.
- Accommodates user ambiguity and varied phrasing.

## 2. AI-Powered Content Personalization

This pattern adapts the narrative content of the flow to the user's specific context or preferences.

**Concept**: The structure of the flow remains fixed, but the `content` of each node is dynamically generated or modified by an AI before being displayed.

**How It Works**:

1.  The application maintains a user profile, which could include preferences like `tone: 'formal'`, `language: 'es'`, or `expertise: 'beginner'`.
2.  A node's `content` is written as a prompt or a template, e.g., `"content": "Explain the concept of photosynthesis in a simple, encouraging tone."`
3.  Before rendering the node, the `FlowEngine` sends this content prompt and the user's profile to an AI model.
4.  The AI rewrites or generates the content to match the requested parameters (e.g., providing a simple explanation in Spanish with an encouraging tone).

**Benefits**:

- Highly personalized and adaptive user experiences.
- Enables multi-lingual support and adjusts for different user skill levels without needing separate flows.

## 3. AI-Driven State Extraction

This pattern uses AI to initialize the flow's state from unstructured data, automating the first step of many workflows.

**Concept**: At the start of a flow, the user provides a block of unstructured text (like an email, support ticket, or product review). An AI model parses this text to extract key entities and populates the `globalState`.

**How It Works**:

1.  The flow is designed to handle a specific task, like triaging a support ticket.
2.  The `startNode` is configured to accept a block of text as input.
3.  This text is sent to an AI model with instructions to extract specific pieces of information (e.g., `customerName`, `issueType`, `urgency`, `productID`).
4.  The AI returns a structured JSON object with the extracted data.
5.  The `FlowEngine` uses this JSON to initialize its `globalState`.
6.  The rest of the flow can now use this state to make decisions, such as routing a high-urgency ticket directly to a senior engineer.

**Benefits**:

- Automates data entry and classification.
- Allows ZFlo to be the engine for workflows that begin with unstructured information.

## 4. AI-Generated Dynamic Branching

This is the most advanced pattern, where the AI is given the power to modify the flow's structure in real-time.

**Concept**: A node can delegate the creation of its own outlets to an AI, leading to new, dynamically generated paths in the flow.

**How It Works**:

1.  A `ZFNode` contains a prompt instead of predefined outlets, e.g., `"dynamicOutletPrompt": "The user wants to troubleshoot their slow internet. Generate three logical next steps as choices."`
2.  The `FlowEngine` sends this prompt to an AI model.
3.  The AI generates a list of choices (e.g., `["Restart the router", "Check for outages", "Run a speed test"]`).
4.  Crucially, the AI could also generate the basic nodes that these choices should lead to.
5.  The `FlowEngine` dynamically adds these new outlets and nodes to the current session's flow graph and presents them to the user.

**Benefits**:

- Creates truly adaptive and non-deterministic user journeys.
- Useful for brainstorming, research, or complex problem-solving where the path is not known in advance.

## 5. AI-Powered Flow Analysis & Optimization

This pattern uses AI as a development assistant to improve the quality of the flows themselves.

**Concept**: An AI analyzes a `ZFFlow` graph definition to identify potential design flaws, suggest improvements, or refactor the logic.

**How It Works**:

1.  From within an editor, a designer can trigger an "AI Analysis" action.
2.  The entire `ZFFlow` JSON is sent to an AI model.
3.  The AI is prompted to act as an expert narrative or systems designer and look for issues like:
    - Dead-end branches or unreachable nodes.
    - Confusing or overly similar choices.
    - Opportunities to merge redundant paths.
    - Paths that don't seem to alter the state in a meaningful way.
4.  The AI returns a list of suggestions, which the designer can then choose to apply.

**Benefits**:

- Improves the quality and robustness of authored flows.
- Acts as a "second pair of eyes" for designers, catching subtle logical errors.
